# GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PARCEL STANDARD (GBPS) - SBHACK19 - Intelligent Parcels

We are proud to introduce the *Global Blockchain Parcel Standard* as our submission for the Intelligent Parcels vertical in the Swiss Blockchain Hackathon 2019.

This README document serves three purposes:
1. Provide an overview of the basic idea of our system.
2. Serve as a set-up guide for our system as hosted on our Amazon S3 bucket.
3. Give a management summary for busy judges!

If you would like to inspect our hardware solution, please feel free to call **+49 157 73847564**.

## Overview

### Our Hackathon Submission
The logistics of last-mile delivery increasingly pose challenges to its stakeholders. Customers requesting specific delivery times, congested cities and resulting regulations, inefficient routes to remote areas and empty trips are just some of the examples.
An innovative solution to these challenges is to leverage other networks for last-mile transport, such as the mobility sharing economy, pizza delivery services, or autonomous machines.
However, this poses a variety of challenges as well. How do you integrate the individual networks transparently and efficiently? How do you handle permissions and traceability, and how do you establish trust in the first place?

During the hackathon, we built an end-to-end system for the integration of external stakeholders for "hard-to-deliver" (too far off, too late) parcels on the last-mile. In particular, we enable parcel dispatchers (e.g. Die Post) to offer their unwanted parcel to other networks as well as a ridesharing user (representing this other network) to deliver the parcel for cash, all connected through a decentral blockchain layer. This use case illustrates and technically builds on our broader vision (see below) perfectly, which is constituted by our **Global Blockchain Parcel Standard**.

In particular, we built the following components:

+ A web application with a multi-layer user interface for parcel dispatchers.
+ A (mobile) ridesharing web application with live maps, displaying the delivery jobs.
+ Several smart contracts connecting these two applications and providing logic.
+ A decentral Quorum logistics blockchain network hosting these smart contracts.
+ As well as a functional hardware box with a self-built smart lock to illustrate further services and think the service end-to-end.

### Our Vision
In the light of digitization, environmental exigencies as well as new modes of transport and changing customer requirements, the (parcel) logistics sector faces various challenges. While other sectors get disrupted one by one, the parcel logistics sector is still largely based on structures from decades ago. However, the new external demands require a parcel logistics solution fit for the 21st century.

The good news is, a wide variety of solutions for many of the challenges outlined before is already available. Companies such as *slock.it* create smart locks for enabling secure access to physical assets (such as parcels), start-ups like *modum.io* enable trustful tracking of critical transports and initiatives like *TradeLens* improve interorganizational shipping processes. The bad news is that these solutions are often based on isolated data silos, monopolist market structures, opacity, interorganizational process inefficiency and difficulties to enter markets sustainably. What is missing is a common infrastructure to connect all these brilliant individual solutions, enabling collaboration and efficient integration.

>We envision our **Global Blockchain Parcel Standard** to bridge the individual services and thereby create an innovative ecosystem for innovations in the parcel logistics sector. A first step has already been presented with our smart contract standards, smart lock hardware solution and the creation of our private Quorum logistics blockchain in the Hackathon.

## Set-up Guide
To test our system, you require nothing more than a web browser and some curiosity.

1. Blockchain and so on?
2. Front-End for dispatcher
3. Front-End for sharer

The repository should be fairly self-explanatory, but here are some hints nevertheless:

## Key Take-Aways
+ During the hackathon, we built a decentral and open end-to-end system for the integration of non-logistics networks for delivering "hard-to-deliver" parcels on the last-mile.
+ Our vision is that our **Global Blockchain Parcel Standard** bridges individual parcel logistics services and thereby creates an innovative ecosystem for innovations in this and other sectors.
